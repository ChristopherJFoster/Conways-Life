# Implementing Conway's Life (using React)

### The Project

I'm currently in the second of two computer science units at Lambda School (and my final unit overall). Our project this week was to implement Conway's Life—including our choice of bells and whistles—in a language/framework of our choosing. I chose React (exclusively Hooks) and Material-UI.
