# Implementing Conway's Life (using React)

### The Project

I'm currently in the second of two computer science units at Lambda School (and my final unit overall). Our project this week was to implement Conway's Life—including a few bells and whistles—as a front-end app in a language/framework of our choosing. I chose React (exclusively Hooks) along with Material-UI for some easy control components.

### Brushing off the Cobwebs

...stuff about using React/MUI recently, but not in this way.

### Generate the Next Frame

...something about how logic/algorithms is one of my favorite parts of coding

### Performance Woes: To <canvas> or Not to </canvas>

### Focus on the Strengths

something about how it would be good to fix the problem, but not if there isn't time

colors / presets

### Deployment to the Rescue

### What Did I Learn?
